1. read requirements
2. create jira account and write / estimate tickets
3. create free aws account and verify docker deployment to ecs
4. build out db tables, columns, dummy data, constraints

5. deploy be to ecs
    update memory to be in free tier
    may need to install jdk with yum

7. build out model for schema validation using objection.js
8. complete crud endpoints as dictated in requirements
9. deploy to serverless, update webpack to avoid minimization
10. export insomnia data to file

questions:

are all fields required?

do we allow for 9 digit zip or require 5 digit?

is it possible that there may be a third status at some future time (ie pending)?

default new user to active or inactive?

is it possible to get an svg of the logout icons? also are icons on sidebar
meant to change based on page the two on manage recipients look a bit like the one on
create recipients was split apart.

how should pagination function? according to the mock ups it looks like we
should include all results from the first page but increase the number shown
upon clicking "view more" -- this is not as performant as having multiple pages
and limiting the number rendered at one time but effects will be negligible
until showing 1000s of rows.
